      "my name is Arsel Giowou.  I was born on July 3, 2002. I have been playing baseball since the age of 8.  in 2013 I was in Japan for a training camp at WCBF (World Childrenâ€™s baseball fair).  after having obtained several experiences in the game while playing, I decided to found my own academy in order to transmit my experience to the children of my country by teaching them how to love and be passionate about the game.",

    bio:
      "I discovered baseball when I was a child through the tickets of my big brothers Wilfrid and Romaric who were my coaches.  Near them I learned to love baseball and especially to love playing it.  In 2009 I went to Japan to WCBF world baseball fair for children. Returning from Japan with different difficulties to continue training our elders became discouraged and we dropped this magnificent sport. I met Arsel and together we decided to share our knowledge and love for the game with as many  Cameroonians as possible",
